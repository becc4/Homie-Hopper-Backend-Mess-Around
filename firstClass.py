# Possible class structure for handling back end of Homie Hopper
# There will be 3 classes: User, Math, and Data
#   User: will store an individual user's data
#   Math: will store euclidean distance as d, pearson correlation coefficient as r, and
#   use user data from the user class
#   Data: will extract and format necessary user data from the json
# 
# ALL CLASS STRUCTURES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE
